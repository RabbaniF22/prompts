I'll extract the best practices for prompting from the VAPI prompting guide:

# Best Practices for Prompting Based on VAPI Guide

1. **Use sectional organization**:
   - Identity (define persona/role)
   - Style (establish tone guidelines)
   - Response Guidelines (specify formatting preferences)
   - Task & Goals (outline objectives and steps)

2. **Break down tasks step-by-step** with clear sequential instructions and conditional logic.

3. **Control response timing** by explicitly indicating when to wait for user responses.

4. **Include explicit tool integration** instructions with clear references to tool names and functions.

5. **Implement silent transfers** when appropriate to maintain seamless user experience.

6. **Include fallback and error handling mechanisms** to gracefully manage unexpected inputs.

7. **Iterate continuously** on prompts through testing and refinement.

8. **Use Markdown formatting** to structure content clearly.

9. **Apply emotional prompting** with expressive language to shape AI's tone.

10. **Add voice realism** through natural speech elements:
    - Stuttering (repeated letters/sounds)
    - Hesitations (fillers like "uh," "um")
    - Pauses (using ellipses)
    - Emotional emphasis (capitals, exclamation marks)

11. **Spell out numbers** instead of using numerals for more natural voice responses.

12. **Add personality and tone** instructions to make assistants more human-like.

13. **Measure success rate** as percentage of requests handled without human intervention.

14. **Follow the process**: Design → Test → Refine → Repeat.
